# Zen Cart

ZenCart is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack. It is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users who can browse through various products, add them to their cart, and make secure payments using Stripe integration. User authentication and authorization are managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features of the site.

The frontend of ZenCart is built using React with Chakra UI for styling, providing a clean and modern user interface. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB serving as the database for product and user information. Stripe integration is used to handle secure payments, allowing users to make purchases with confidence.
